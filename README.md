## This is the repository for [My Live Portfolio](https://sjrdev.uk)

A simple static website that showcases my skills, my projects, and my experience.

### What Tech did i use?:

-   I used HTML5 for the structure of the content on the website.
-   I used vanilla javascript to add functions to the page, such as the dropdown menu, the light/dark mode switch and the landing page.
-   I used SASS in place of base CSS due to personal interest. Whilst it worked great, I think I didn't make the most of the features available to me.
-   I used AWS's S3 and CloudFront tech to allow for my GIFs to be stored on the cloud.
    -   This dramatically improves load times for pages such as the portfolio which has many GIFs.

### What did i learn?:

-   When implementing a dark mode, create a base class, then create themes that change the colors on that class instead of making two separate classes
    -   ~~This means i don't have to edit two elements each time~~ addressed this in the second version
-   Develop the page mobile first, then create the desktop version after...
-   Spend more time looking at accessibility

### FAQ

-   'YOUR SITE LOOKS RUBBISH! THERE'S NO STYLING!!!'
    -   Chances are that Ive changed the css since you last visited the site, please clear your browsers cache and reload the site.
-   'Are you going to keep changing the website?'
    -   Of course, i want to keep this website updated and current. I also want to use this repository as a way of showing how my skills have developed over time.
-   The CV button doesnt do anything
    -   i am currently waiting feedback on my new CV design, and dont feel that my previous CV reflects my skills well enough - ill add a link to it as soon as i believe it to be ready to send to employers.
