# Portfolio

This is the repository for my portfolio on : https://sjrdev.uk

# What Tech did i use?:

    - I used HTML5 for the structure, as most people do.
    - I used vanilla javascript to add functions to the page, such as the dropdown menu, the light/dark mode switch and the landing page.
    - I used SASS in place of base CSS due to personal interest. Whilst it worked great, I think I didn't make the most of the features available to me.
    - I used AWS's S3 and CloudFront tech to allow for my GIFs to be stored on the cloud. - This dramatically improves load times for pages such as the portfolio.

# What did i learn?:

    - When implementing a dark mode, create a base class, then create themes that change the colors on that class instead of making two separate classes
        - This means i don't have to edit two elements each time
    - Develop the page mobile first, then create the desktop version after...
    - spend more time looking at accessability
