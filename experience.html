                        I studied computer science at GCSE level, where i learnt
                        a lot of theory and basic Python skills, we touched on
                        subjects like binary shifts, pseudocode, flowcharts,
                        fetch-decode-execute cycle, and more. In my opinion,
                        this is where i got into programming, as to me being
                        able to tell a computer what you want it to do - and
                        then it doing it - was fascinating to me.

                        Starting in september 2019, for my first year i studied
                        electronic engineering, but after the first year i
                        decided to change to Computer science as i realised i
                        was spending alot of my time looking at programming
                        topics and trying out different technology rather than
                        researching about circuitry. I then went on to do a 2
                        Year computer science level 3 BTEC, where i learnt the
                        basics of app development, networking, software
                        development, hardware, and more. while i didnt
                        completley get what i wanted out of my 2 year BTEC, i
                        did learn a lot of useful theory and techniques that i
                        still use today.

                        During my first year of college i got a part time job at
                        the local sainsburys near where i lived to fund myself
                        through college, working at sainsburys has definitley
                        helped me improve my confidence in talking to new
                        people, and working in a team. Working at sainsburys has
                        also helped me to stick to a schedule.

                        During college i did work experience at a software
                        company near where i live. It was a great experience
                        learning about relational data in a SQL database, how to
                        use the .NET framework, Docker and more. During this
                        time i created the League API while shadowing one of the
                        Software architects - who was really helpful in
                        explaining different topics, and gave me a reference. he
                        even included things that i should research in my own
                        time - which was really helpful for me.
