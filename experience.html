                        I studied computer science at GCSE level, where I learnt
                        a lot of theory and basic Python skills, we touched on
                        subjects like binary shifts, pseudocode, flowcharts,
                        fetch-decode-execute cycle, and more. In my opinion,
                        this is where I got into programming, as to me being
                        able to tell a computer what you want it to do - and
                        then the computer doing it - was fascinating to me.

                        Starting in September 2019, for my first year I studied
                        electronic engineering, but after the first year I
                        decided to change to Computer science as I realized I
                        was spending a lot of my time looking at programming
                        topics and trying out different technology rather than
                        researching about circuitry. I then went on to do a 2
                        Year computer science level 3 BTEC, where I learnt the
                        basics of app development, networking, software
                        development, hardware, and more. While I didn't
                        completely get what I wanted out of my 2-year BTEC, I
                        did learn a lot of useful theory and techniques that I
                        still use today.

                        During my first year of college, I got a part time job
                        at the local Sainsbury's near where I lived to fund
                        myself through college, working at Sainsbury's has
                        definitely helped me improve my confidence in talking to
                        new people, and working in a team. Working at
                        Sainsbury's has also helped me to stick to a schedule.

                        During college, I did work experience at a software
                        company near where I live. It was a great experience
                        learning about relational data in a SQL database, how to
                        use the .NET framework, Docker and more. During this
                        time I created the League API while shadowing one of the
                        Software architects - who was really helpful in
                        explaining different topics, and gave me a reference. He
                        even included things that I should research in my own
                        time - which was really helpful for me.
