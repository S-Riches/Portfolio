                            During my sixth week of my JustIT boot camp i was
                            tasked with creating a project within the week, so i
                            decided to create a text editor within the browser
                            using vanilla javascript, CSS, and HTML. I also
                            carried over my newly adopted 'beautified README'
                            skills to create good documentation. The project is
                            hosted on github pages, allowing anyone to try it
                            out. The project allows for the user to edit
                            existing files, create new files (.md or .txt), and
                            provides basic text editor functionality (i.e. a
                            line counter)
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            'Typing Game' is a Static website that i created
                            over two days to help me practice my typing skills
                            after using
                            <a href="https://www.keybr.com/">KeyBR</a>. The
                            project only uses basic web languages (HTML, CSS,
                            and JS). The most important thing i learned after
                            creating this project is the importance of creating
                            beautified README files, as it makes even a simple
                            project a lot more interesting to look at, and
                            allows the developer to showcase notable features -
                            To understand what I mean, I recommend you look at
                            the readme file on the repo. The tools i used for
                            the Readme included BannerMaker, Carbon, and
                            Shields.io.

                            Movie Database, as the name states, is a full stack
                            application utilizing Python for the backend with
                            Flask, MySQL for the database and Bootstrap 5 &
                            Vanilla JavaScript for the frontend. The project is
                            ran using docker containers that work in parallel to
                            scrape movies from NowTV, Prime Video, and All4. The
                            data is then stored in the database, and accessible
                            through the client I wrote. The API also has a cron
                            job built in so that it re-scrapes the sites and
                            prunes the database of old movies at 10pm.

                            Dads Website is a website I built for my dads
                            business - for this I simply used bootstrap 5 to
                            create a responsive design which met his
                            requirements for the website. It contains a carousel
                            of before and after photos of clearances my dad had
                            done, along with an embed of his waste carrier
                            licences that users could then click to verify. The
                            website also had buttons at the bottom that would
                            allow you to quickly send an email, or call him for
                            a quote.

                            The League API project is the project I worked on
                            during my work experience at Wizard Group. It uses
                            the C# .NET framework to make a call to the Riot
                            API, with the user's league name, the API then gets
                            the user ID and comes back with the user's match
                            History. Unlike the Movie Database, it follows the
                            MVC model (model view controller). However, during
                            this time that i worked on this project due to it
                            being a bank holiday on the Friday at the end of the
                            week i never go around to creating the frontend,
                            therefore this project requires postman to work.

                            During my time at JustIT's software development boot
                            camp I created a mock-up site called codeBlogs; for
                            the first week of CSS. While the site has no
                            functionality, it does have quite a clean look to it
                            and is responsive. While I plan to create a blog
                            website, I'm not sure if I will use this design but
                            its a possibility.

                            The Download Folder Sorter was a project i created
                            due to my downloads folder getting really
                            unorganized. So my solution was to create an
                            algorithm that views each file, looks at the file
                            type and sorts it into a respective folder. This
                            simple Python file uses the Shutil library and
                            TKInter for a nice UI that serves its purpose.

                            One of my final units at college was to create an
                            application in Java for children. So I created an
                            application called 'Mentally Maths' - the concept of
                            the game is quite simple really: allow a user to
                            choose a difficulty level (two with a timer), give
                            multiple choice answers, and inform the user through
                            sounds if they were correct or incorrect. Due to me
                            finishing the base program before the submission
                            deadline - I added a timer bar that shows the user
                            how much time they have left for each question.

                            Another project I did at college was a Map for a
                            fictional shopping centre, which simply showed the
                            user where shops, toilets, restaurants, etc. could
                            be located within the AMAP shopping centre. This
                            project used Bootstrap 5.

                            The To-Do Website was the first time I looked into
                            web development - it is a very cookie cutter website
                            that you see most people create at one point or
                            another. It displays the time to the user, it has a
                            delete feature for each to-do object, and it has a
                            alternating pattern for each item on the list to
                            make it easier to see different items without the
                            need for borders

                            One of the first notable python apps I made was this
                            video downloader using Pytube. However, as seen from
                            the GIF above, the app needs some updating to get
                            going again. It uses TKInter to show a GUI to the
                            user, and it gave feedback after the file was
                            downloaded. I also created a random string generator
                            to create a title for the file.

                            Earlier this year, I tasked myself with learning the
                            fundamentals of C++, which then led me to create
                            this Vending machine application, which is a simple
                            proof of concept more than anything.
