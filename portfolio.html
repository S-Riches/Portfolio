                            Movie Database, as the name states, is a full stack
                            application utilizing Python for the backend with
                            Flask, MySQL for the database and Bootstrap 5 &
                            Vanilla JavaScript for the frontend. The project is
                            ran using docker containers that work in parallel to
                            scrape movies from NowTV, Prime Video, and All4. The
                            data is then stored in the database, and accessible
                            through the client i wrote. The API also has a cron
                            job built in so that it re-scrapes the sites and
                            prunes the database of old movies at 10pm.

                            Dads Website is a website i built for my dads
                            business - for this i simply used bootstrap 5 to
                            create a responsive design which met his
                            requirements for the website. It contains a carousel
                            of before and after photos of clearances my dad had
                            done, along with an embed of his waste carrier
                            licenses that users could then click to verify. The
                            website also had buttons at the bottom that would
                            allow you to quickly send an email, or call him for
                            a quote.

                            The League API project is the project i worked on
                            during my work experience at Wizard Group. It uses
                            the C# .NET framework to make a call to the Riot
                            API, with the users name, the api then gets the user
                            id and comes back with the users match History.
                            Unlike the Movie Database, it follows the MVC model
                            (model view controller). However during this time
                            that i worked on this project due to it being a bank
                            holiday on the friday at the end of the week i never
                            go around to creating the frontend, therefore this
                            project requires postman to work.

                            camp i created a mockup site called codeBlogs; for
                            the first week of CSS. while the site has no
                            functionality, it does have quite a clean look to it
                            and is responsive. while i plan to create a blog
                            website, im not sure if i will use this design.

                            The Download Folder Sorter was a project i created
                            due to my downloads folder getting really
                            unorganized. So my solution was to create an
                            algorithm that views each file, looks at the file
                            type and sorts it into a respective folder. This
                            simple Python file uses the Shutil library and
                            TKInter for a nice UI that serves its purpose.

                            One of my final units at college was to create an
                            application in Java for children. So i created an
                            application called 'Mentally Maths' - the concept of
                            the game is quite simple really: allow a user to
                            choose a difficulty level (two with a timer), give
                            multiple choice answers, and inform the user through
                            sounds if they were correct or incorrect. Due to me
                            finishing the base program before the submission
                            deadline - i added a timer bar that shows the user
                            how much time they have left for each question.

                            be located within the AMAP shopping centre. The

                            another. it displays the time to the user, it has a
                            delete feature for each todo object, and it has a
                            alternating pattern for each item on the list to
                            make it easier to see different items without the

                            video downloader using Pytube, however as seen from
                            the gif above, the app needs some updating to get
                            going again. It uses TKInter to show a GUI to the
                            user, and it gave feedback after the file was
                            downloaded. I also created a random string generator
                            to create a title for the file.

                            Earlier this year i tasked myself with learning the
                            fundamentals of C++, which then led me to create
                            this Vending machine application, which is a simple
                            proof of concept more than anything.
